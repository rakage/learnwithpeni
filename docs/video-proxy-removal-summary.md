# Video Proxy Removal - Implementation Summary

## Problem
Customers with low connection speeds were experiencing "failed to get video" errors when trying to watch course videos. The issue was caused by the video proxy system adding unnecessary overhead and complexity to video streaming.

## Solution Implemented
We removed the video proxy and implemented direct S3 video streaming for better performance and reliability.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Video Utility Functions (`lib/video-utils.ts`)
- Created `getDirectVideoUrl()` function that returns direct S3 URLs
- Updated `getProxiedVideoUrl()` for backwards compatibility (now returns direct URLs)
- Removed proxy URL generation logic

### 2. Simplified Video Player Component (`components/ProtectedVideoPlayer.tsx`)
- Removed authentication logic and proxy-related code
- Updated to use direct S3 URLs with cache-busting parameters
- Simplified error handling for better user experience
- Changed `crossOrigin` attribute to `"anonymous"` for public S3 access

### 3. Updated S3 CORS Configuration
- Added support for `PUT` and `POST` methods (required for file uploads)
- Included necessary headers for both video streaming and file uploads
- Added your production domain `https://learnwithpeni.com`
- Configured proper `ExposeHeaders` for video range requests

### 4. Created Automation Scripts
- `scripts/setup-s3-cors.js` - Automated CORS configuration setup
- `scripts/s3-cors-config.json` - JSON configuration for AWS CLI usage

## Current S3 CORS Configuration

```json
[
  {
    "ID": "AllowVideoStreamingAndUploads",
    "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
    "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "HEAD", "PUT", "POST"],
    "AllowedOrigins": [
      "http://localhost:3000",
      "https://localhost:3000", 
      "https://*.vercel.app",
      "https://*.netlify.app",
      "https://learnwithpeni.com",
      "*"
    ],
    "ExposeHeaders": [
      "Content-Range",
      "Content-Length", 
      "Accept-Ranges",
      "Content-Type",
      "ETag",
      "x-amz-server-side-encryption",
      "x-amz-request-id",
      "x-amz-id-2"
    ],
    "MaxAgeSeconds": 3600
  },
  {
    "ID": "AllowVideoRangeRequests",
    "AllowedHeaders": [
      "Range",
      "If-Range",
      "Authorization",
      "Content-Type",
      "Content-Length", 
      "Content-MD5",
      "x-amz-content-sha256",
      "x-amz-date",
      "x-amz-security-token"
    ],
    "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "HEAD", "PUT", "POST"],
    "AllowedOrigins": ["*"],
    "ExposeHeaders": [
      "Content-Range",
      "Accept-Ranges",
      "Content-Length",
      "ETag"
    ],
    "MaxAgeSeconds": 86400
  }
]
```

## Benefits

### For Low-Bandwidth Users:
- ✅ Direct S3 streaming eliminates proxy server bottleneck
- ✅ Better CDN utilization through AWS CloudFront
- ✅ HTTP Range requests support for efficient video seeking
- ✅ Reduced latency by removing middleware layer

### For System Performance:
- ✅ Reduced server load (no longer proxying video content)
- ✅ Better scalability (S3 handles traffic spikes)
- ✅ Lower bandwidth costs on your server
- ✅ Simplified authentication flow

### For File Uploads:
- ✅ No more CORS errors during uploads
- ✅ Support for direct S3 uploads
- ✅ Proper handling of presigned URL uploads

## Files Modified
1. `lib/video-utils.ts` - Updated video URL functions
2. `components/ProtectedVideoPlayer.tsx` - Simplified video player
3. `scripts/setup-s3-cors.js` - CORS configuration script
4. `scripts/s3-cors-config.json` - CORS configuration JSON

## Legacy Components
The video proxy API (`app/api/video-proxy/[...path]/route.ts`) is still present but no longer used. You can optionally remove it after confirming everything works correctly.

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test video playback with slow internet connections
2. Verify video seeking works properly
3. Test file uploads to ensure no CORS errors
4. Check video playback on different devices/browsers
5. Monitor S3 bandwidth usage

## Rollback Plan
If issues occur, you can temporarily revert by:
1. Restoring the original `getProxiedVideoUrl()` function
2. Reverting `ProtectedVideoPlayer.tsx` changes
3. Re-enabling the video proxy route

The changes are backwards compatible, so rollback should be seamless if needed.
