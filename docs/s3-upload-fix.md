# 🔧 AWS S3 Upload Fix - Environment Variables Issue

## 🚨 **Problem**

You were getting the error:

```
❌ S3 upload error: Error: No value provided for input HTTP label: Bucket.
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

The issue was that **environment variables are not accessible in client-side code** in Next.js. Only environment variables prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` are available in the browser.

Your AWS credentials (including `AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME`) were only available on the server-side, but the `FileUpload` component and course creation page were trying to access them directly in the browser.

## ✅ **Solution**

Created a **server-side API endpoint** for file uploads instead of direct client-side S3 calls:

### **1. New API Endpoint** (`/api/upload/s3`)

- Handles file uploads on the server-side where environment variables are available
- Includes authentication validation
- Returns the uploaded file URL to the client

### **2. Updated Client Components**

- `components/FileUpload.tsx` - Now uses FormData and fetch to call the API
- `app/admin/courses/create/page.tsx` - Uses the same API approach
- Both components include proper authentication headers

## 🔄 **How It Works Now**

### **Client Side (Browser)**

1. User selects a file
2. File is validated (size, type)
3. FormData is created with the file
4. API call to `/api/upload/s3` with authentication token
5. Progress tracking and UI updates

### **Server Side (API)**

1. Validates user authentication
2. Extracts file from FormData
3. Uses AWS SDK to upload to S3 (environment variables available here)
4. Returns file URL to client

## 📁 **File Flow**

```
Browser (Client) → API Endpoint (Server) → AWS S3 → File URL → Client
```

## 🔧 **Key Changes**

### **Created:**

- `app/api/upload/s3/route.ts` - Server-side upload API
- Updated `components/FileUpload.tsx` - Uses API instead of direct S3
- Updated `app/admin/courses/create/page.tsx` - Uses API for all file uploads

### **Benefits:**

- ✅ **Security**: AWS credentials stay on server-side
- ✅ **Authentication**: Validates user before upload
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Better error messages and logging
- ✅ **Consistency**: All uploads go through the same secure flow

## 🧪 **Testing**

### **1. Verify S3 Configuration**

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/test-s3
```

Should return: `"success": true` with bucket configuration

### **2. Test File Upload**

1. Login to your admin panel
2. Create a new course
3. Upload course image, videos, or documents
4. Files should upload successfully and URLs should point to your S3 bucket

### **3. Check S3 Bucket**

Visit AWS S3 Console → Your bucket (`learnwithpeni`) → Should see uploaded files organized by:

```
learnwithpeni/
├── course-content/
│   ├── videos/
│   ├── images/
│   ├── documents/
│   └── archives/
└── courses/
    └── {course-id}/
        ├── videos/
        ├── images/
        └── documents/
```

## 🚀 **You're All Set!**

Your AWS S3 integration is now working properly with:

- ✅ **Secure server-side uploads**
- ✅ **Proper authentication**
- ✅ **1GB file size limits**
- ✅ **Organized file structure**
- ✅ **Direct S3 URLs** (no CDN needed)

**Next steps**: Test uploading files in your course creation interface! 🎯
