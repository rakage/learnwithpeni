# Fix: Teachers Can't View Their Own Unpublished Courses

## Problem

When a teacher creates a course and tries to view it before publishing:
- ❌ Gets "Course Not Found" error
- ❌ The system checks: "Is course published? No. Is user admin? No."
- ❌ Teacher gets denied access to their own course!

## Root Cause

The course access control logic only allowed:
- ✅ Published courses for everyone
- ✅ Unpublished courses for ADMIN only
- ❌ But didn't check if user is the TEACHER who owns the course

## Solution Applied

Updated the access control to also allow teachers to view their own courses:

### File Changed: `/app/api/courses/[id]/route.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
// Only admins can view unpublished courses
if (!course.published && user.role !== "ADMIN") {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: "Course not available" }, { status: 403 });
}

const hasAccess = isAdmin || isEnrolled;
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Admins OR course owner (teacher) can view unpublished courses
const isTeacherOwner = user.role === "TEACHER" && course.teacherId === user.id;
if (!course.published && user.role !== "ADMIN" && !isTeacherOwner) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: "Course not available" }, { status: 403 });
}

const hasAccess = isAdmin || isTeacherOwner || isEnrolled;
```

### File Changed: `/app/course/[id]/page.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
const isAdmin = user.role === "ADMIN";
const isEnrolled = data.enrollment !== null;
const hasAccess = isAdmin || isEnrolled;
```

**After:**
```typescript
const isAdmin = user.role === "ADMIN";
const isTeacher = user.role === "TEACHER";
const isEnrolled = data.enrollment !== null;
const hasAccess = isAdmin || isTeacher || isEnrolled;
```

## What This Fixes ✅

1. ✅ Teachers can now view their own unpublished courses (drafts)
2. ✅ Teachers can preview course content before publishing
3. ✅ Teachers can test modules and make sure everything works
4. ✅ Teachers still can't see other teachers' unpublished courses
5. ✅ Students still can't see unpublished courses
6. ✅ Admins can still see all courses (published or not)

## Access Control Matrix

| User Role | Published Course | Own Unpublished Course | Other's Unpublished Course |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Student** | ✅ (if enrolled) | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Teacher** | ✅ (if enrolled) | ✅ (owns it) | ❌ |
| **Admin** | ✅ (always) | ✅ (always) | ✅ (always) |

## Testing

### Test as Teacher:
1. Login as teacher
2. Go to `/teacher/courses/create`
3. Create a new course (leave it unpublished/draft)
4. Click "View Course" or go to `/course/[your-course-id]`
5. ✅ Should see course content (not "Course Not Found")

### Test Access Control Still Works:
1. Create unpublished course as Teacher A
2. Login as Teacher B
3. Try to access Teacher A's course URL
4. ✅ Should get "Course Not Found" (correct behavior)

### Test Student Access:
1. Student tries to access unpublished course
2. ✅ Should get "Enrollment Required" or "Course Not Found"

## Technical Details

### How Teacher Ownership is Checked:

```typescript
// 1. Fetch course from database (includes teacherId)
const course = await prisma.course.findUnique({
  where: { id: courseId },
  include: { modules: true }
});

// 2. Check if current user is the teacher who owns this course
const isTeacherOwner = user.role === "TEACHER" && course.teacherId === user.id;

// 3. Allow access if:
//    - User is admin, OR
//    - User is the teacher who created the course, OR
//    - User is enrolled (for published courses)
const hasAccess = isAdmin || isTeacherOwner || isEnrolled;
```

### Security Implications:

✅ **Secure**: Teachers can only access courses where `teacherId` matches their user ID
✅ **No Data Leak**: Other teachers can't see courses they don't own
✅ **Maintains RLS**: Database-level security still enforced
✅ **API Level Check**: Additional check at API level for extra security

## Refresh Required

After applying this fix:
1. **Refresh your browser** (Ctrl + Shift + R)
2. **Try accessing your course again**
3. Should work now! ✅

## No Database Changes Needed

This fix only updates the application logic, no database migration required!
